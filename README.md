## Abstract
*In this paper, we propose DeepDeblurRF, a novel radiance field deblurring approach that can synthesize high-quality novel views from blurred training views with significantly reduced training time. DeepDeblurRF leverages deep neural network (DNN)-based deblurring modules to enjoy their deblurring performance and computational efficiency. To effectively combine DNN-based deblurring and radiance field construction, we propose a novel radiance field (RF)-guided deblurring and an iterative framework that performs RF-guided deblurring and radiance field construction in an alternating manner. Moreover, DeepDeblurRF is compatible with various scene representations, such as voxel grids and 3D Gaussians, expanding its applicability. We also present BlurRF-Synth, the first large-scale synthetic dataset for training radiance field deblurring frameworks. We conduct extensive experiments on both camera motion blur and defocus blur, demonstrating that DeepDeblurRF achieves state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis quality with significantly reduced training time.*

## Getting Started

### 0. Install requirements

Create a conda environment and install dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n ddrf python=3.8
conda activate ddrf
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd NAFNet/
python setup.py develop --no_cuda_ext
```

### 1. Download pretrained weights

Download all pretrained weights for the deblurring networks from the following link:

[Google Drive - weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16QBdHTkZ7xUm2zqeBtLFNZaSD1Qx1h-R?usp=sharing)

Place them in:
```
DDRF/NAFNet/weights/
```

---

### 2. Prepare your test data

Place your scene folder inside `data/`, e.g.:

```
data/cozyroom/
├── blur/                  # blurry input images
├── nv/                    #  view images (for NVS testing)
├── hold=<k>               # NVS split (e.g., 1 every k frames)
```

- `blur/` should contain the training images **excluding** holdout indices
- `nv/` should contain the held-out images (those used for novel-view synthesis testing)

---

### 3. Run preprocessing

Open and run `preprocess.ipynb`. It performs:

- Initial deblurring with NAFNet_SD → `deblur/deblur_0/`
- Radiance field setup → `rf/rf_0/images/`

Expected result structure:

```
data/cozyroom/
├── blur/
├── nv/
├── hold=<k>
├── deblur/
│   └── deblur_0/
├── rf/
│   └── rf_0/
│       └── images/
│       └── hold=<k>
```

---

### 4. Run the DDRF pipeline

Choose the appropriate config file based on your dataset:

```
configs/
├── blurrf_synth/
│   ├── motion/
│   └── defocus/
├── blurrf_real/
├── dbnerf_real/
│   ├── motion/
│   └── defocus/
```

Example:
```bash
python ddrf.py -c configs/blurrf_synth/motion/cozyroom.txt
```

This will run the full iterative training and deblurring pipeline.

Final novel-view synthesis results will be saved in:
```
data/<scene_name>/Final_results/
```

## Iterative Pipeline Structure in DeepDeblurRF

DeepDeblurRF is built as an iterative pipeline that progressively refines novel-view synthesis from blurry inputs. Each iteration consists of radiance field (RF) construction and RF-guided deblurring. 

The structure below summarizes the process:

| Iteration (`index`) | RF Input Folder | Rendered Views (train/test) | NAFNet Settings           | RF-Guided Deblur Output | Final Output         |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1                   | `rf_0`           | `trviews_1`, `tsviews_1`     | `NAFNet-width64_1.yml`     | `deblur_1`               | ❌                    |
| 2                   | `rf_1`           | `trviews_2`, `tsviews_2`     | `NAFNet-width64_2.yml`     | `deblur_2`               | ❌                    |
| 3                   | `rf_2`           | `trviews_3`, `tsviews_3`     | `NAFNet-width64_3.yml`     | `deblur_3`               | ❌                    |
| 4                   | `rf_3`           | `trviews_4`, `tsviews_4`     | `NAFNet-width64_4.yml`     | `deblur_4`               | ❌                    |
| 5                   | `rf_4`           | `trviews_5`, `tsviews_5`     | *(skipped)*                | *(not created)*          | ✅ `tsviews_5`         |

- Iteration starts from `index = 1`. Each RF input `rf_{index-1}` is constructed from `deblur_{index-1}` and novel views (`nv`).
- The initial deblur input `deblur_0` is generated beforehand via `preprocess.ipynb`.
- Rendered views `trviews_{index}` and `tsviews_{index}` are generated from the trained RF.
- RF-guided deblurring is applied using the original `blur` images and the rendered `trviews_{index}`, producing `deblur_{index}`.
- NAFNet weights (`NAFNet-width64_k.yml`) change per iteration (up to 4 models).
- On the final iteration (`index = 5`), deblurring is skipped and `tsviews_5` is considered the final output.

Final results are saved in:
```
data/<scene_name>/Final_results/
```

Example:
```
data/cozyroom/Final_results/
```

**Note:** The radiance field module used in each iteration is modular and can be replaced with other RF representations (e.g., voxel grids, NeRF).
